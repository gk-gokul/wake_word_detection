# wake_word_detection
Developed a wake word detection system using deep learning, trained with 100 instances of 'Hey Jarvis' audio samples. Utilized sound processing techniques, LSTM neural networks, and spectrogram analysis. The model detects the wake word in real-time audio inputs with an accuracy of 98%, facilitating voice-activated commands in smart devices.
